									<h3 class="major">eSports Infographic</h3>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/34m23Hz/infographic.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>The objective here was to create two infographic solutions displaying the same information in two different ways. The topic was eSports and the rapid growth that has occurred within the field in the past ten or so years, so to stay with that theme I used color palettes common in gaming-related materials as well as typefaces and imagery that give off a tech feel.</p>


									<h3 class="major">Ray's Hell Burger Website</h3>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/DbDdzyj/rayshell.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>This is a redesign of restaurant’s website and brand. With the name “Ray’s Hell Burger” being a pun, I wanted to play up the humor and hell theme in the site’s design and the brand voice. The scope of the project included designing the restaurant’s home page and menu page, as well as coding both from scratch.</p>
									
									
									<h3 class="major">Streetmark Magazine</h3>

									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XXKCWsx/magazine3.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>Streetmark is a collaborative project in which three other team members and I worked together to create a full magazine centered on the streetwear subculture and fashion. Each of us were to design three covers and a brief, then split up the remaining duties. I was in charge of the logo and signage, a hybrid feature with a three-spot illustration, and a text feature with a full page illustration. The challenge was to keep Streetmark’s bold and fresh aesthetic consistent in all the different components of the magazine.</p>
									<p>The images above are from the brief I created for Streetmark. My section was focused on the international aspect of streetwear, and featured brands from around the world.</p>
