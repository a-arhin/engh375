	Hi I'm Amanda, but you can call me A. I am a senior Graphic Design major at GMU, and this class is the last 3 credits I need to graduate. I took an AVT web design course before &#40;example of the work I did in that class can be found <a href="work.html#rayshell">here</a>&#41;, but that was a few years ago, so I was glad to have this opportunity to refresh my skills.</p>
	<p>Currently, I do freelance graphic design and illustration as well as designing for charity projects while completing my schooling. Aside from illustration and graphic design, my intersts include video games, character design, music, and food.
